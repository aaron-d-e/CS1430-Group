from reddit:

For a pinball game, the first thing would be to have a ball rolling down an angled plane with a bunch of solid objects on it. In order to do that you need to find out how to use the physics engine of your game engine. Unity and Unreal won't even need any programming for that (not even visual programming).

Then you need the flippers. Two more physics objects which move rapidly on keyboard input. So you need to learn how keyboard input works and how to make physics objects move on them.

Then you need bumpers. So find out how to detect collisions and how to apply forces when a collision is detected.

And then you likely notice how dull your game looks, and you want to create a fancy looking table in a 3d modeling program. So you google for a basic Blender tutorial.
